Backend services for ingritofood 

IngritoFood -> See what recipes can be made from the ingredients you have at hand. Made with ReactJS and C++ backend and a
TCP Server written in C++ to communicate between frontend and backend.

Background
------
What we have made is basically a web-based virtual recipe book in which the user can
append the ingredients they have on hand and the application parses through
thousands of recipes to filter out and display the ones that can be cooked with the
items available.
